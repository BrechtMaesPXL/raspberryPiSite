# raspberryPiSite

A website built with Hugo that allows users to submit posts in markdown format. It's designed to run on any host, makinbg it accessible and reliable. With a clean and simple design, users can easily navigate and find what they're looking for, while the robust back-end (you, but for now my raspberry pi 3B) ensures smooth performance.
